# 🌳 Decision Tree Classifier

This project implements a **Decision Tree Classification** model using a real-world dataset. It includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization of the decision tree to understand decision paths and rules.

## 📁 Dataset

**File:** `DT_dataset.csv`  
The dataset includes features suitable for classification, such as:

- Age
- Estimated Salary
- Purchased (Target variable)

## 📌 Features of the Project

- Load and explore dataset using Pandas
- Data preprocessing and train-test split
- Train Decision Tree using `scikit-learn`
- Model evaluation using:
  - Confusion Matrix
  - Accuracy Score
- Visualize the Decision Tree using `graphviz`

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python 3.x**
- **Pandas**
- **NumPy**
- **Matplotlib**
- **Seaborn**
- **scikit-learn**
- **Graphviz** (for tree visualization)

## 🔍 Key Steps

1. Load dataset and understand structure
2. Clean and preprocess data
3. Split data into training and testing sets
4. Train a Decision Tree Classifier
5. Evaluate model performance
6. Visualize the tree structure
